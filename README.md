# NASSCOM-Semiconductor-Packaging-Workshop
# Packaging Evolution: From Basics to 3D Integration
# Semiconductor Packaging Design & Testing ‚Äì Ansys AEDT Project

This repository presents a complete hands-on journey through semiconductor package development using **Ansys Electronics Desktop (AEDT)**, including **design, modeling, testing, and reliability analysis**. It follows a 5-module structure covering real-world steps in packaging ICs using wire bonding.

| Die Bond Pads         | Copper            | 0.2 mm √ó 0.2 mm       | 0.005 mm         |
| Substrate Bond Pads   | Copper            | 0.2 mm √ó 0.2 mm       | 0.01 mm          |
| Bond Wires            | Gold              | JEDEC 4-point         | ‚Äî                |
| Mold Compound         | Epoxy             | 5 mm √ó 5 mm           | 1.2 mm           |

#### üõ†Ô∏è AEDT Modeling Steps:
1. **Set up units** in mm in Q3D layout
2. **Draw die** and assign material as Silicon
3. **Create substrate**, offset under die, assign FR4
4. **Add die attach** layer (modified epoxy) between die and substrate
5. **Place bond pads** on die and substrate using copper
6. **Connect pads using bond wires**, JEDEC 4-point, gold
7. **Encapsulate with mold compound** to protect wires and die
8. **Color code parts** for easy visual identification
